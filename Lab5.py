This lab is designed to get you familiar with Python Functions, parameters, return values, Type Hinting, and Docstrings.

Hint you will want to enable word wrap in vscode (View -> Toggle Word Wrap) to make it easier to read the instructions.

# 1. Write a function called number_squared(num) that takes a number as a parameter and prints out the number squared. Include Type Hinting and a Docstring.

# 2. Write a function called string_counter(str) that take a string as a parameter and tell you how many letters are in the string. Include Type Hinting and a Docstring.

# 3. Write a function called string_repeater(str, num) that takes a string and a number as parameters and prints out the string repeated that many times. Include Type Hinting and a Docstring.

# 4. Write a function called number_adder(num1, num2) that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the sum of the two numbers. Include Type Hinting and a Docstring.

# 5. Write a function called jacket_checker(temp, raining) that takes in a temperature (int) and whether it is raining (bool) as parameters and prints out whether you should wear a jacket or not. If the temperature is above 60 Degrees and it is not raining you should return not to wear a jaket. Return a String "Wear a Jacket" or "Do not wear a Jacket".  Include Type Hinting and a Docstring.

# 6. Write a function that asks the user for a temperature and whether it is raining and then calls the jacket_checker function to tell the user whether they should wear a jacket or not. Your returned value should be the output of jacket_checker. Include Type Hinting and a Docstring.

# 7. Import the random module and write a function called random_number() that returns a random number between 1 and 10. Include Type Hinting and a Docstring.

# 8. Import floor from the math module (using from <module> import <function>) and write a function called round_down(num) that takes a number as a parameter (float) and returns the number rounded down to the nearest whole number. Include Type Hinting and a Docstring.
